# KittyLang
I am rewriting kittylang a programming language written by cats for cats </br>
following https://craftinginterpreters.com/ as a guide :P</br>
Currently writing the interpreter(jcat)</br>
Will be followed by the compiler in C (ccat)</br>

jcat can currently "scan" the source code/repl for tokens</br>
and output them accordingly</br>

# Interpreter
jcat - implemented in java

### To run the interpreter(at it's current start) via command line use:
  - `java -jar jcat.jar <filename>.kln` to run a file
  - `java -jar jcat.jar` to open up the interactive REPL
